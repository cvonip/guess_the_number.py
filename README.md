# Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²

This is a Python-based command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides hints for each guess, making it fun and challenging!

## Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Provides feedback for each guess:
  - "Too low!"
  - "Too high!"
  - "Congratulations!" if guessed correctly.
- Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric guesses).

## Why I Built This
I created this project as my first step into Python programming. It helped me learn:
- Loops and conditionals.
- User input validation.
- Random number generation with Python's `random` module.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cvonip/guess_the_number.py.git
